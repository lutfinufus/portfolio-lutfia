                <h3>Lorenzo Shipping Company Analysis</h3>
                <p>
                  &nbsp;In this project, I will explain how I analyzed the shipping company datasets obtained from the data.world website. 
                  I will detail the methods used to examine various aspects of the data, including customer metrics, shipment volumes, annual revenue, 
                  and operational details such as the number of trucks and drivers. Additionally, I will discuss the insights gained from the analysis, 
                  how these insights contribute to understanding market trends and the implications for strategic decision-making.
                  This analysis involved utilizing SQL and exploring several essential commands to process a large volume of raw datasets</p>
                  
                  <p>&nbsp;SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language for storing, manipulating, cleaning, 
                  and retrieving data in a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS), thereby enabling the execution 
                  of activities on databases consisting of multiple tables and rows with large datasets. SQL can be integrated with various platforms, 
                  such as Python. MySQL is an open-source Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) for data storage, aiding developers in creating data-driven applications. 
                  This project aims to discover useful information and suggest conclusions from the Lorenzo Shipping Company files, by utilizing tools:
                  <img class="center zoom" src="img/5/tools.png" alt="ERD" width=400 height=300/>
                  </p>

                  <br><h5>ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) in Database Design</h5>
                  <p>&nbsp;To design an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD), the initial step is to analyze the project summary to identify entities, attributes, and relationships. 
                    A unique identifier is used to distinguish one entity from another and can connect to one or more entities. An attribute is a characteristic that describes an entity.                   
                    <br><figure><img class="center zoom" src="img/5/ERD.JPG" alt="ERD" width=480 height=400/><figcaption>      
                      This ERD image contains attributes, represented by the primary keys (PK) of entities, which uniquely identify each record. Additionally, foreign keys (FK) are used to establish relationships between entities.
                    </figcaption></figure></p>                
                  <br><h4>Data Preparation</h4>
                  <p>In this process, raw data is prepared for further processing by importing datasets from CSV files, including:
                    <ul>
                      <li>City</li>
                      <li>Customer</li>
                      <li>Driver</li>
                      <li>Shipment</li>
                      <li>Truck</li>
                    </ul>
                  </p>
                  <h5>1. Data Definition Language (DDL)</h5>
                  <p>DDL (Data Definition Language) is a set of SQL commands used to define the database structure or schema, including tasks such as creating, modifying, and deleting database objects.
                   
                  <ul>
                    <li><code>CREATE</code>: A command used to create a new database or table involves specifying the details of columns. A table can have multiple columns, each defined by name, data type, and optionally, 
                      constraints such as whether the column requires a value (NOT NULL) or adheres to referential integrity (e.g., primary key, foreign key) according to the data requirements. Below are the data types used in this project:
                      <ul type="circle">                    
                        <li>Integer (INT())</li>
                        <li>Variabel Character (VARCHAR())</li>
                        <li>Decimal (M, D)</li>
                        <li>Datetime: format "YYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS"</li>
                        <li>Date: format "YYY-MM-DD"</li>
                        <li>Year: format "YYY"</li>
                        <li>Text</li></ul>                                   
                      <figure><img class="center zoom" src="img/5/database.JPG" alt="create database" width=260 height=110/>
                      <br><img class="center zoom" src="img/5/create-table.JPG" alt="create table" width=260 height=120/>
                      
                      <figcaption>The CREATE DATABASE statement is used to create a new database, while the CREATE TABLE statement is used to define the structure of a new table within that database (including names, data types, and other details). This is illustrated by the truck table I created</figcaption></figure>
                    </li>         
                     
                </ul></p>
                
                <h5>2. DML (Data Manipulation Language)</h5>
                  <p>After importing the datasets from CSV files into MySQL database, check each entry individually to ensure that the data has loaded correctly. 
                    The following commands are used:
                    <ul>
                      <li><code>SELECT</code>: A command used to retrieve and display specific data from a table.
                            
                                          
                      <figure><img class="center zoom" src="img/5/select.JPG" alt="select statement" width=220 height=250/>
                              <img class="center zoom" src="img/5/city-table.JPG" alt="city table" width=480 height=200/>
                      <figcaption>This image displays a selection from the 'city' table using the SELECT * statement.</figcaption>
                      </figure></li>
                      
                      
                      
                      <li><b>Copying raw data and inserting new data</b> similar to the existing data for further processing aids in maintaining the original data. 
                        This is accomplished by creating a new table and inserting similar data using the <code>INSERT</code> and LIKE commands.
                        <figure><img class="center zoom" src="img/5/insert.JPG" alt="INSERT Command" width=200 height=200/><figcaption>
                          Using the CREATE TABLE ... LIKE statement creates an empty table that matches the structure of another table, including all columns, attributes, and indexes defined in the original table. 
                          This image displays a selection from the 'city' table to create a new table and insert similar data</figcaption></figure>
                      </li></ul></p>
                    
                    
                  <br><h4>Data Cleaning</h4>
                  <p>This process aims to identify and correct inconsistent data, such as duplicates, 
                    missing values, and other discrepancies. It ensures that the data is accurate and consistent, 
                    thereby facilitating easier analysis and reporting.
                  </p>
                    <h5>Identify Duplicates</h5>
                    <p>Duplicate values in each column are generally not allowed in data tables but can be present in new, raw, or uncontrolled data. To verify whether a column contains duplicates, the following SQL command can be used:                            
                      <ul>
                        <li><code>COUNT</code>: An aggregate function that counts all rows or specific rows, identifying records that match certain conditions.</li>                        
                        <li><code>GROUP BY</code>: A clause used to group all rows based on the same column value. This clause is typically used with aggregate functions such as COUNT, MAX, MIN, SUM, AVG, etc. The HAVING clause is used with GROUP BY to exclude groups that do not fulfill certain criteria.                  
                        <figure><img class="center zoom" src="img/5/duplicate.JPG" alt="duplicate Command" width=430 height=300/>
                        
                        <figcaption>To determine the total number of records in each column, use the COUNT(*) function. The GROUP BY clause is used to group all rows with identical values, which consists of multiple columns such as 'make' and 'model year'. The HAVING clause is then used to filter these results after the GROUP BY operation. 
                          By utilizing the COUNT() function within the HAVING clause to check if any group contains more than one element, duplicate groups can be identified.
                         </figcaption></figure></li>
                          
                          <li><code>WHERE</code>: This clause is used to specify criteria or conditions for retrieving data from a table. When combined with the AND logical operator, it ensures that all specified criteria are fulfilled for the query to execute.
                            <figure><img class="center zoom" src="img/5/where.JPG" alt="where statement" width=380 height=320/>
                              <br><img class="center zoom" src="img/5/duplicat-check.JPG" alt="duplicate check Command" width=260 height=150/>

                            <figcaption>To determine whether duplicates exist, check the shipment_staging table for truck_id = 9 and truck_id = 10 using the WHERE clause. The results indicate that there are no duplicates in any of the data columns.
                            </figcaption>
                            </figure></li>                
                    </ul>
                    </p> 
                   

                    <h4>Analyze the Data</h4>
                    <p>In this stage, I will explore the information from all datasets included in this project. The list of questions will be addressed, followed by the query inputs and the resulting outputs. These results will be used to create a dashboard that represents the answers to the most critical components, thereby addressing the business problems.

                        <img class="center zoom" src="img/5/lowest-result-annual.JPG" alt="DELETE Command" width=300 height=300/>
                      <figcaption>Using this syntax, the query retrieves data from the customer_staging table by calculating the total annual revenue with the SUM function on the annual_revenue column, followed by grouping the data by state. 
                        The results are sorted by total annual revenue in descending order (from highest to lowest) and in ascending order (from lowest to highest). 
                        The data will display the top 10 records.</figcaption>

                        The data above indicates the 10 states with the highest and lowest total annual revenue. Annual revenue is a crucial metric for representing the performance and value of all services sold over a full year. 
                        The most profitable markets, based on the top three states, are CA, OR, and FL, while the lowest profitable are OK, MT, and MN. For the top three cities, the most profitable are Cleveland, Kenner, and Riverside, while the lowest profitable are Denver, Dallas, and Elkhart. The aspects that can be analyzed are:                     
                        <ul>
                          <li>Budget Planning: Understanding annual revenue by state and city aids in budget planning. The company can set realistic revenue targets and draft an appropriate budget for each region.
                          </li>
                          <li>Adjustment of Rates and Services: This data can be used to adjust rates and services according to the characteristics and needs of each state and city, 
                            thereby enhancing customer satisfaction and the company's competitiveness.</li>
                          <li>Market Development: This data is important for market development. The company can identify expansion opportunities in underutilized cities with high growth potential.</li>
